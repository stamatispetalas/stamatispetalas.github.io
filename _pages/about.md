Creating an entire ocean out of ones and zeros, and then allowing it to swirl, flow, overturn and move around inside a computer, is a deeply fascinating and strangely rewarding craft.   
Examining the intimate relationship formed between the atmosphere and the ocean at their meeting point, while devising explanations on the ways their energy and water interactions can affect both of them in unexpected ways and places, is both a scientific venture as well as a philosophical quest.   
Contemplating on how two distant, vast bodies of water can use a narrow line-like connection between them, to communicate climate signals to each other, is like tuning in to an internal _ballad of the salty sea_.

> Now, the challenging part is performing the above while being of service to the community by delivering useful products.

Welcome, I'm Stamatis, a Physicist and postdoc Researcher in Physical Oceanography at Democritus University of Thrace (DUTH), Xanthi, Greece. My affiliation is with the [Department of Environmental Engineering](https://env.duth.gr/en/) and specifically the [Laboratory of Ecological Engineering & Technology](https://env.duth.gr/en/laboratories/lab5/).

This site serves as a medium to introduce myself and share the interests, passions and creative endeavors of my academic life, while also slipping in flavors of personal experiences. Have a look around!

My work and research
======
In my research I study the physical oceanography of the eastern Mediterranean with a special focus on Greek Seas and their interaction with neighboring basins, as well as the ocean influence on local climate and coastal systems through air-sea interactions, sea level rise and wave action. 

I do this by configuring hydrodynamic numerical simulations and analyzing their results in combination with data from observations. My main interests include Ocean Dynamics, Air-Sea Interactions, Extreme Events, Climate Forecasting, and evaluation of Climate Change, Variability and their impact on systems.

My background and history
======
I received my Ph.D in Physical Oceanography from University of the Aegean, my M.Sc. in Meteorology, Physical Oceanography and Climate from Utrecht University, and my B.Sc. in Physics from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. <!-- from the UC-Berkeley School of Information, my M.A. from the Communication, Culture, and Technology program at Georgetown University, and my B.A. in the Humanities program at the University of Texas at Austin. For just under five years after receiving my Ph.D, I was at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science as a staff ethnographer. At BIDS, I was first a postdoctoral scholar, then became a principal investigator and led several research and education efforts, including the institute’s Data Science Studies efforts and the Best Practices in Data Science series.-->

<!-- My intellectual communities
======
I’m a disciplinary nomad, ....integrating disciplines like computer science, information science, social psychology, and organization/management science with fields like philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and history of science and technology. In terms of academic specialties, I spend a lot of my time in the fields of Science and Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and new media / internet studies. Methodologically, while I am trained as a qualitative ethnographer, I also rely on other qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods. I often use more statistical forms of analysis to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches, frequently collaborating with people from other disciplines. I frequently speak at conferences and events, and I also consult with various groups, organizations, and companies about a wide range of topics.-->
