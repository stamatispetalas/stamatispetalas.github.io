Creating an entire ocean out of ones and zeros, and then allowing it to swirl, flow, overturn and move around inside a computer, is a deeply fascinating and strangely rewarding craft.   
Examining the intimate relationship formed between the atmosphere and the ocean at their meeting point, while devising explanations on the ways their energy and water interactions can affect both of them in unexpected ways and places, is both a scientific venture as well as a philosophical quest.   
Contemplating on how two distant, vast bodies of water can use a narrow strait connection between them, to communicate climate-signals to each other, is like tuning in to an internal _ballad of the salty sea_.

> Now, the challenging part is performing the above while being of service to the community by delivering useful and applicable products

Welcome, I'm Stamatis, a Physicist and postdoc Researcher in Oceanography at Democritus University of Thrace (DUTH), Xanthi, Greece. My affiliation is with the [Department of Environmental Engineering](https://env.duth.gr/en/) and specifically the [Laboratory of Ecological Engineering & Technology](https://env.duth.gr/en/laboratories/lab5/).

This website is meant to serve as a medium for introducing myself and sharing the interests, passions and creative endeavors of my academic life, while also slipping in flavors of personal experiences. Have a look around!

My work and research
------
In my research I study the physical properties of the eastern Mediterranean with a special focus on Greek Seas and their interaction with neighboring basins, as well as the ocean influence on local climate and coastal systems through air-sea interactions, sea level rise and wave action. I do this by configuring hydrodynamic numerical simulations and analyzing their results in combination with data from observations.

My wider academic research interests extend to anything that has to do with understanding and simplifying complex systems through theory, conceptual modelling, analytical approaches and interpretation of observations. Aside my main work, I also enjoy side-projects which I research and study in my free time; I briefly cover some of them here.

My background and history
------
I was born and raised in Alexandroupolis, a town in north-eastern Greece. Upon finishing high school I moved to Thessaloniki to study Physics. I received my B.Sc. from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH), with a specialization on Atmospheric Physics. My Bachelor's Thesis was completed under the supervision of prof. Metaxia Manolopoulou ([Radiation Physics Group](http://radiation.physics.auth.gr/)) at the [Laboratory of Atomic and Nuclear Physics](https://www.physics.auth.gr/en/research_labs/63), on measuring methods in Environmental Radioactivity titled: "_Study on the response of He-3 proportional counter with Monte Carlo methods_".

I then moved to The Netherlands pursuing a M.Sc. degree in Meteorology, Physical Oceanography and Climate at Utrecht University. My Master's Thesis was conducted under the supervision of professors Bart van den Hurk (KNMI) and Aarnout van Delden (UU/IMAU), as an intern at KNMI (the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute), with the title: "_Assessing the response of vegetation energy fluxes to heat-waves using the H-TESSEL land surface scheme_".

Right after completing my thesis, I had to return to Greece to complete my mandatory service in the Hellenic Armed Forces, as Crew Managing & Operations Officer (Corporal) in the Corps of Engineers. <!--During my service I went through several schools, from cadet-officer school to a multitude of weapons, mine-warfare & explosives schools.--> When discharged, I moved to my home town where I worked for a couple of years as a physics instructor, providing tutoring services and preparing high-school students for their final-year examinations in Physics and Mathematics.

At that point I moved to Mytilene in Lesvos island, where I did my Ph.D research in Physical Oceanography at the University of the Aegean, under the supervision of professors Elina Tragou (UAegean), Vassilis Zervakis (UAegean) and Elena Xoplaki (University of Giessen). My Ph.D was titled: "_Development of a Hydrodynamic Simulation for the Study of Climate Change and Variability in the Aegean Sea_".

<!-- My intellectual communities
------
Iâ€™m a disciplinary nomad, ....integrating disciplines like computer science, information science, social psychology, and organization/management science with fields like philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and history of science and technology. In terms of academic specialties, I spend a lot of my time in the fields of Science and Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and new media / internet studies. Methodologically, while I am trained as a qualitative ethnographer, I also rely on other qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods. I often use more statistical forms of analysis to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches, frequently collaborating with people from other disciplines. I frequently speak at conferences and events, and I also consult with various groups, organizations, and companies about a wide range of topics.-->
