*Ocean current flows in the Mediterranean (from NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio)*

I'm Stamatis, a Researcher at Democritus University of Thrace, Xanthi with affiliation to the [Department of Environmental Engineering](https://env.duth.gr/en/) and the [Laboratory of Ecological Engineering & Technology](https://env.duth.gr/en/laboratories/lab5/).

My work and research
======
In my research I study the physical oceanography of the eastern Mediterranean with a special focus on Greek Seas and their interaction with the Black Sea, as well as the ocean influence on local climate and coastal systems through air-sea interactions, sea level rise and wave action. 

I do this by configuring hydrodynamic numerical simulations and analyzing their results in combination with data from observations. My main interests include Ocean Dynamics, Air-Sea Interactions, Extreme Events, Climate Forecasting, and evaluation of Climate Change, Variability and their impact on systems.

Main topics of Interest
------
- Numerical simulations
