Creating an entire ocean out of ones and zeros, and then forcing it to swirl, flow, overturn and move around in your computer is something deeply fascinating and strangely rewarding. Especially when you realize that this newborn digital sibling, that came into existence through the study of fluid dynamics, is getting more and more akin to its elder brother --the majestic salty Ocean.

I'm Stamatis, a postdoc Researcher in Physical Oceanography at Democritus University of Thrace (DUTH), in Xanthi. My affiliation is with the [Department of Environmental Engineering](https://env.duth.gr/en/) and the [Laboratory of Ecological Engineering & Technology](https://env.duth.gr/en/laboratories/lab5/). 

On this site, I'm sharing the interests, passions and creative endeavors of my academic life, without missing out on some flavoring from every-day-life experiences. Have a look around!

My work and research
======
In my research I study the physical oceanography of the eastern Mediterranean with a special focus on Greek Seas and their interaction with the Black Sea, as well as the ocean influence on local climate and coastal systems through air-sea interactions, sea level rise and wave action. 

I do this by configuring hydrodynamic numerical simulations and analyzing their results in combination with data from observations. My main interests include Ocean Dynamics, Air-Sea Interactions, Extreme Events, Climate Forecasting, and evaluation of Climate Change, Variability and their impact on systems.

Main topics of interest
------
- Numerical Modelling
- Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
- Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean Dynamics
- Climate Change & Variability
- Extreme Events
- Ocean Waves

My background and history
======
I received my Ph.D in Physical Oceanography from University of the Aegean, my M.Sc. in Meteorology, Physical Oceanography and Climate from Utrecht University, and my B.Sc. in Physics from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. <!-- from the UC-Berkeley School of Information, my M.A. from the Communication, Culture, and Technology program at Georgetown University, and my B.A. in the Humanities program at the University of Texas at Austin. For just under five years after receiving my Ph.D, I was at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science as a staff ethnographer. At BIDS, I was first a postdoctoral scholar, then became a principal investigator and led several research and education efforts, including the institute’s Data Science Studies efforts and the Best Practices in Data Science series.-->

<!-- My intellectual communities
======
I’m a disciplinary nomad, ....integrating disciplines like computer science, information science, social psychology, and organization/management science with fields like philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and history of science and technology. In terms of academic specialties, I spend a lot of my time in the fields of Science and Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and new media / internet studies. Methodologically, while I am trained as a qualitative ethnographer, I also rely on other qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods. I often use more statistical forms of analysis to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches, frequently collaborating with people from other disciplines. I frequently speak at conferences and events, and I also consult with various groups, organizations, and companies about a wide range of topics.-->
