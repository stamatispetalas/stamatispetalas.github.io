I am a Physical Oceanographer

Research
======
In my research I study the physical oceanography of the eastern Mediterranean with a special focus on Greek Seas and their interaction with the Black Sea, as well as the ocean influence on local climate and coastal systems through air-sea interactions, sea level rise and wave action. 

I do this by configuring hydrodynamic numerical simulations and analyzing their results in combination with data from observations. My main interests include Ocean Dynamics, Air-Sea Interactions, Extreme Events, Climate Forecasting, and evaluation of Climate Change, Variability and their impact on systems.

Topics of Interest
------
- Numerical simulations
- Geophysical fluid dynamics
- Air-Sea interactions
- Climate change and variability
- Extreme events
- Wave modelling

Teaching
======
During the last few years I have provided teaching assistance in the following courses:

Undergraduate level:
------
- Physics
- Climate Change and the Ocean
- Descriptive Oceanography
- Introduction to Dynamical Oceanography
- Oceanography of the Mediterranean

Graduate level:
------
- Operational Oceanography and Hydroacoustics


**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
